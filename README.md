### Hello! 👋🏽

My name is Maanas Peri, and here's a bit about me:
- I'm currently a Software Engineer at Uber.
- I graduated with a Master's at Cornell Tech in NYC, did my undergrad in CS at UMass Amherst.
- I'm a self-proclaimed chef dabbling in Thai, Italian, and Indian cuisines.
- My current interests revolve around Distributed Systems such as Apache Cassandra, and LLM-powered Full-Stack applications. I'm particularly interested in using my product intuition and startup experiences to guide what I build.
- Lastly, everyone who knows me well can attest to my obsession with Notion. I hope you learned a bit about me, and Go Hawks! 🏈 

I've pinned a few projects that are mostly relevant to my current interests, but there are 2 more exciting ones I'm going to put up here! I'm always looking for high-impact projects, so if you'd like to get in touch with me, hit up my socials!
