### Hello! 👋🏽

My name is Maanas Peri, and here are the ABCs of me:
- I'm a Master's Student at Cornell Tech in NYC 🌃
- I'm deeply interested in IOS & Web Development, particularly applications in fintech, health & fitness, and productivity industries 🚴🏾‍♂️

I'm currently working on a variety of projects this summer and will update my project spaces by September 2023. In the meantime if you would like to reach out feel free to hit me up on my socials :)
