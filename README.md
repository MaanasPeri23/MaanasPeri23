### Hello! 👋🏽

My name is Maanas Peri, and here's a bit about me:
- Master's Student at Cornell Tech in NYC 🌃
- I have a profound passion for building Data and Machine Learning Engineering applications in the fashion-tech, fintech, health and fitness, and productivity sectors. I'm particularly interested in using product design and startup experiences to guide what I build. 🛠️
- I'm currently learning more about Computer Vision techniques, Generative Models, Big Data concepts through Apache Spark and Kafka, and building robust ML pipelines in Azure. 🧑🏽‍💻
- Certified Notion fanatic 🎧 
- Go Hawks! 🏈 

I've pinned a few projects that are mostly relevant to my current interests, but there are more exciting ones in the works! I'm always looking for high-impact projects, so if you'd like to get in touch with me, hit up my socials!
